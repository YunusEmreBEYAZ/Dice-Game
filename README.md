## How to play:
* Player 1 starts first.
* Roll the dice until it comes 1.
*If it isn't 1 then you can roll again. But be careful if it comes 1 your current point will be 0.
*If you hold your score then it will be save and it turns to other player 
* If it comes 1 game switches to player 2
* Same rules for player 2 
* Who reaches to 100 wins.
